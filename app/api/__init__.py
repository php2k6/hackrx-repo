# Here you can define your FastAPI routes related to document processing.
# For example, you might want to add endpoints for uploading documents, querying them, etc.

# Example route (to be implemented):
# @router.post("/upload/")
# async def upload_document(file: UploadFile):
#     # Logic to handle file upload and processing
#     pass

# Include additional routes as needed.
